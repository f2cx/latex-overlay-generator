# LaTeX Overlay Generator

If you want to annotate screenshots or other figures in your LaTeX papers,
the following small tool might help.

It creates the whole source code needed to create annotated figures as shown
on the right directly in LaTeX without modifying the underlying image file.
You can also use the tool to embed any text on top of your figure
(e.g., use \cite commands on top of an image). Give it a try! :-)

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Deployment & Demo
